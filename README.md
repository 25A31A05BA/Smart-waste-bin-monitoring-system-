A Smart Waste Bin Monitoring System is an IoT-based solution that uses sensors and connectivity to monitor and optimize waste collection. Here's how it works;: Core Components Sensors:UItrasonic or infrared sensors measure fill levels in real-time, detecting how full each bin is (typically 0-100%).Microcontroller: A device like Arduino
