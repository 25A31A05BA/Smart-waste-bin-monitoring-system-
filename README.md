# Smart-waste-bin-monitoring-system-
A Smart Waste Bin Monitoring System is an IoT-based solution that uses sensors and connectivity to monitor and optimize waste collection. Here's how it works;: Core Components Sensors:UItrasonic or infrared sensors measure fill levels in real-time, detecting how full each bin is (typically 0-100%).Microcontroller: A device like Arduino
Connectivity: Wi-Fi, LoRaWAN, NB-JoT,or cellular networks transmit data to the cloud for remote monitoring.
Power Supply: Battery or solar-powered systems ensure continuous operation in various locations.
Cloud Platform: A central server or IoT
platform (AWS IoT, Azure loT
ThingSpeak) stores and processes the data.
User Interface: Web or mobile dashboards display bin status, analytics, and alerts for waste management teams.
Key Features
•Real-time fill level monitoring with
percentage indicators
·GPS location tracking for each bin • Automated alerts when bins reach capacity thresholds
Historical data analytics for waste
generation patterns
• Temperature sensors to detect fires or
hazardous conditions
• Weight sensors for monitoring waste
volume
Benefits
This system reduces operational costs by eliminating unnecessary collection trips, decreases fuel consumption and
emissions, prevents overflow situations, improves urban cleanliness, and enables data-driven decision making for waste management planning
